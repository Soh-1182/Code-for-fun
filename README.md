In repository, lab-samples, I will be sharing code, and resources for making amazing projects. You can you these for science fairs too. We will be working with the following microcontrollers:

1. Arduino Uno R3

2. Arduino Uno R4 WIFI and BLUETOOTH

3. ESP32

Most of the code is on the uno series, the rest is on esp32. I would prefer buying the Arduino UNO R4 WIFI  becuase the Arduio UNO R4 WIFI is a better version of Arduino UNO R3 and has a ESP32S3 for WIFI, Bluetooth, and  BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). All programs are compatable with Arduino UNO R4 WIFI. Some programers are compatable with Arduino UNO R3, while the rest are compatable with ESP32. 

Happy coding!
